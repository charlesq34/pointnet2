### ScanNet Data

Original dataset website: <a href="http://www.scan-net.org/">http://www.scan-net.org/</a>

You can get our preprocessed data at <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApbTjxa06z9CgQhxDuSJPB5-FHtm">OneDrive link</a> and refer to the code in `scannet_util.py` for data loading. Note that the virtual scan data is generated on the fly from our preprocessed data.

Some code we used for scannet preprocessing is also included in `preprocessing` folder. You have to download the original ScanNet data and make small modifications in paths in order to run them.
